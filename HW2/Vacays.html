        "Although Taiwan occupies less than one percent of the Earth’s land, it is home to a diverse landscape, ranging from winding gorges and misty mountains to hot springs and tropical beaches. Portuguese sailors en route to Japan in the late 16th century deemed Taiwan “Ilha Formosa,” or beautiful island, and for good reason. Its cultural legacy is equally rich, combining Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, aboriginal and modern influences. Whether hiking through <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Taroko_Gorge" target="blank">Taroko Gorge</a>’s walls of swirling marble, exploring the world’s largest collection of Chinese artifacts at the <a href="https://www.npm.gov.tw/en/" target="blank">National Palace Museum</a> in Taipei, or cycling around turquoise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Moon_Lake" target="blank">Sun Moon Lake</a>, Taiwan offers something for every traveler. Here are ten destinations not to miss." -<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/10-must-see-places-taiwan-180959207/" target="blank">Credit</a>
