                There's 104 days of summer vacation
                And school comes along just to end it
                So the annual problem for our generation
                Is finding a good way to spend it
                
                Like maybe...
                Building a rocket
                Or fighting a mummy
                Or climbing up the <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en" target="blank">Eiffel Tower</a>
                
                Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey! )
                Or giving a monkey a shower
                
                Surfing tidal waves
                Creating nanobots
                Or locating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" target="blank">Frankenstein</a>'s brain (It's over here! )
                
                Finding a dodo bird
                Painting a continent
                Or driving your sister insane (Phineas! )
                
                As you can see
                There's a whole lot of stuff to do
                Before school starts this fall (Come on Perry)
                
                So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb
                Are gonna do it all
                So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are
