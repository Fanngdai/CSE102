        Warning! Please do not shrink this page. It is <strong>NOT</strong> responsive because of the 5 column requirement! This being said, one of my favorite cewebrities would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSz6JVYmzVhtkraHWZC7HQ" target="blank">Liza Koshy</a>. She is a youtuber/comedian who uploads funny videos. Although I do not watch her on youtube much, I come across some of her funny moments on instagram once in a while. Her videos are unique and she seems like a genuine person. To be honest, I am writing this sentence here because I am just trying to fill up some words. Lets talk about the cartoons to the right of this page. I grew up watching these cartoons. Spongebob is about a sponge who lives in the sea. He lives in a pineapple next to a squid and a starfish. Spongebob works at the Krusty Karbs flipping burgers. Phineas has a brother and named Ferb and a sister Candace. Phineas and Ferb likes to build things and his sister like to snitch on him. This is based off a real story where the sister imagined all these scenarios. Dude likes to build stuff with his brother Ferb. His "twin" brother is said to be adopted. Idk. Taught me that the end of your shoe laces is called the aglet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evcsj1gx1CE" target="blank">A-G-L-E-T</a> This looks like enough things to write :)
