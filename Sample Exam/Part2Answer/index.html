                    <p>Established in 1969, the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University is consistently ranked among the top 20 computer science departments in the nation by the National Research Council. The department is the largest unit in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and is among the largest on the campus. A Gourman report indicated Stony Brook’s undergraduate program, accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, was ranked 15th nationwide and 2nd in New York State.</p>
                    <p>The most recent NRC survey ranked its graduate program among the top 20 graduate programs in the U.S. With an annual research expenditure of roughly $8 million, the department is active in many of the major research areas in computer science. Computer Science faculty and students work closely together in an open, collegial atmosphere. The department is active in many of the major research areas in computer science with specialization in Visual Computing, Computer Systems, Networking, Security, Intelligent Systems, Concurrency and Verification, Algorithms and Computer Science Education. It is the primary participant in the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT), a $50 million High-Tech Center at Stony Brook and one of a handful in New York State. A new 70,000-square-foot state-of-the-art Computer Science Building will open in 2014.</p>
