Introductory Statement - The Web page should have an introductory paragraph that draws in the Web surfer to the site.
Ordered List - The Web page should use at least one ordered list. You may use it for whatever purpose you like, but it must make sense and fit in with the point of the Web site.
Unordered List - The Web page should use at least one unordered list. Again, don't just throw one in, it should be there for good reason.

Images - The Web page should make use of at least 3 images. These may be images of inside, outside, whatever, as long as they are relevant to the page.

Quotations - The Web page should contain at least one quote from a reviewer. For these, you must use the blockquote tag.
Hyperlinked References - The Web page should contain a list of references with hyperlinks to each reference. You should also include inline hyperlinks to any proper nouns in your page. All together you should have at least 10 hyperlinks in your page.
Author & Date of last revision - Include this information at the bottom of your Web page. For the Date of last revision, I have provided a JavaScript snippet that you may simply copy and paste into the body of your document:

</ul>

<ol>
